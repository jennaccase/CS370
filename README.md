What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists problem solve and program solutions to a wide variety of scenarios. This can be programming a game, application, or event AI.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach a problem by trying to break it down to see what the problem is at the core. Then I just try to make a list of the things I need to accomplish to fix the problem. I then work through the list and chip away at it until it is solved.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist I have an ethical responsibility for both the end user and the organization. I have an ethical responsibility to the end user to properly put disclaimers on the code for privacy reasons and to deliver the product to them as the customer. I have the same ethical responsibilities to the prganization the program is for.
